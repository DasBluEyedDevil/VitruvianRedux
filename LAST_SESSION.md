# Last Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Session Focus**: Weight Protocol Fix & Equipment Code Removal
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Critical weight bug fixed, automated tests added, equipment tracking removed

---

## Session Overview

Fixed critical weight accuracy bug where configured weights felt 50% lighter than expected (100 lbs input felt like 50 lbs). Added comprehensive automated tests to prevent regression. Cleaned up codebase by removing unused equipment/attachment tracking system. Minor UI improvements.

---

## ✅ Critical Fix: Weight Protocol Bug

### The Problem
User reported: "Entering 100 lbs gave only 50 lbs resistance"
- Official app: Enter 50 lbs → Get 50 lbs per cable
- Our app: Enter 100 lbs → Get 50 lbs per cable (BUG!)

### Root Cause
The Vitruvian BLE protocol expects **TOTAL weight** at offset 0x58, which the machine then splits between two cables. We were sending per-cable weight directly, causing the machine to halve it again.

### The Fix (ProtocolBuilder.kt:101-116)
```kotlin
// BEFORE (WRONG):
buffer.putFloat(0x58, params.weightPerCableKg)  // Machine halves this!

// AFTER (CORRECT):
val totalWeightKg = params.weightPerCableKg * 2.0f  // Double it
buffer.putFloat(0x58, totalWeightKg)  // Machine splits it correctly
```

**Weight Protocol Summary:**
- **User enters:** Per-cable resistance (e.g., 50 lbs)
- **Protocol offset 0x54:** Effective weight = per-cable + 10kg
- **Protocol offset 0x58:** Total weight = per-cable × 2 (machine splits between cables)
- **Display/History:** Show per-cable resistance (totalLoad / 2)

### Files Modified:
1. **ProtocolBuilder.kt** - Fixed weight doubling calculation
2. **WorkoutTab.kt** - Display per-cable load (totalLoad / 2)
3. **MainViewModel.kt** - Store per-cable weight in history

### Verification:
✅ User tested with 50 lbs input → Got 50 lbs resistance (correct!)

---

## ✅ Automated Testing Added

Created comprehensive unit tests to prevent weight bugs from recurring without hardware testing.

### New Tests (ProtocolBuilderTest.kt:314-451):

1. **`test weight protocol - per cable weight is doubled for total resistance`**
   - Verifies: offset 0x58 = per-cable × 2

2. **`test weight protocol - effective weight is per cable plus 10kg offset`**
   - Verifies: offset 0x54 = per-cable + 10

3. **`test weight protocol - real world scenario 50 lbs per cable`**
   - Tests actual use case matching hardware

4. **`test weight protocol - regression test for weight halving bug`**
   - **Explicitly catches if the "100 lbs → 50 lbs" bug returns**
   - Fails if totalWeight ≤ perCableWeight

### Test Results:
✅ All 18 tests passing (5 new weight tests + 13 existing protocol tests)

---

## ✅ Equipment Tracking Removed

Per user request, removed all equipment/attachment code (was premature/unnecessary).

### Files Modified:
1. **Exercise.kt** - Removed `EquipmentType` enum (Short Bar, Long Bar, etc.)
2. **Models.kt** - Removed `equipment` field from `WorkoutParameters`
3. **Routine.kt** - Removed `equipment` field from `RoutineExercise`
4. **WorkoutEntities.kt** - Removed `equipment` field from database entity
5. **WorkoutRepository.kt** - Removed equipment mapping
6. **WorkoutTab.kt** - Removed equipment parameter from `LiveMetricsCard`

### Database:
- Version already at 5 (from previous session)
- Equipment column removed from `RoutineExerciseEntity`

---

## ✅ Minor UI Improvements

1. **Renamed "Stop At Top" → "Finish At Top"**
   - Clearer language for the option that ends workout at top of final rep
   - Changed in WorkoutTab.kt (appears in exercise setup and live workout)

---

## Build Iterations This Session

Had to perform **nuclear clean** to get weight fix compiled:
```bash
rm -rf app/build .gradle build
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Standard `./gradlew clean` wasn't invalidating Kotlin build cache properly.

**Final Build Status:** ✅ SUCCESSFUL

---

## Files Modified This Session

**Weight Protocol Fix:**
- `util/ProtocolBuilder.kt` - Fixed weight doubling
- `presentation/screen/WorkoutTab.kt` - Display per-cable, UI text changes
- `presentation/viewmodel/MainViewModel.kt` - Store per-cable in history
- `test/protocol/ProtocolBuilderTest.kt` - Added 5 weight protocol tests

**Equipment Removal:**
- `domain/model/Exercise.kt` - Removed EquipmentType enum
- `domain/model/Models.kt` - Removed equipment from WorkoutParameters
- `domain/model/Routine.kt` - Removed equipment from RoutineExercise
- `data/local/WorkoutEntities.kt` - Removed equipment from database entity
- `data/repository/WorkoutRepository.kt` - Removed equipment import/mapping

**Other Changes:**
- `data/local/WorkoutDatabase.kt` - Version 5 (already set previously)
- `data/ble/VitruvianBleManager.kt` - (From previous session - all 7 BLE characteristics)

---

## User Feedback Patterns

1. **Empirical Hardware Testing:**
   - User directly compared our app vs official app with same exercises
   - Provided specific resistance comparisons (50 lbs, 100 lbs)

2. **Weight Display Philosophy:**
   - "For cable machines, even if both cables pulling 50 lbs each, you're technically lifting 50 lbs, not 100"
   - Decision: Track per-cable resistance, not total pull

3. **Testing Fatigue:**
   - "I'm exhausted lol. Can't you create an automated test?"
   - Led to creation of comprehensive unit test suite

4. **Code Simplification:**
   - User identified equipment tracking as premature
   - "We don't care about attachments" → removed entire system

---

## Next Steps

### TODO List (Cleaned Up):
1. **Add ability to edit existing routines** (pending)
2. **Add exercise type selection** (echo mode, TUT, etc.) (pending)
3. **Consolidate exercise creation workflow** (pending)

### Potential Future Work:
- Personal Best tracking system (mentioned by user)
- Chart tracking similar to web app (mentioned by user)
- Per-set reps UI redesign (from previous session notes)

## Technical Notes

### BLE Protocol Weight Encoding
```
User Input: 50 lbs per cable (22.68 kg)

Protocol Frame (96 bytes):
├─ Offset 0x54: effectiveKg = 22.68 + 10.0 = 32.68 kg (float32 LE)
├─ Offset 0x58: totalKg = 22.68 × 2.0 = 45.36 kg (float32 LE)
└─ Machine splits 0x58 value between Cable A and Cable B

Result: 22.68 kg per cable = 50 lbs per cable ✓
```

### Why Double the Weight?
The Vitruvian machine's firmware interprets offset 0x58 as the **combined load** across both cables. It automatically divides this value to control each cable independently. If we send per-cable weight, the machine halves it, resulting in 50% resistance.

This behavior matches the official web app's protocol implementation (reference/web-app/src/protocol.js).
