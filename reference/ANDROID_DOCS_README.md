## 💡 Tips for Success

### Before You Start
- [ ] Read PROJECT_SUMMARY.md completely
- [ ] Decide on development approach (MVP vs Full)
- [ ] Ensure you have access to a Vitruvian machine for testing
- [ ] Gather 2-3 Android test devices (different manufacturers)
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository
- [ ] Recruit at least one other person (even for testing)

### During Development
- [ ] Keep WEB_TO_ANDROID_MAPPING.md open at all times
- [ ] Test on real hardware frequently (weekly minimum)
- [ ] Compare BLE traffic with web app using sniffers
- [ ] Write tests for protocol builders (byte-perfect validation)
- [ ] Ask for help early (GitHub issues, community)
- [ ] Document quirks and workarounds as you find them

### Before Release
- [ ] Complete feature parity checklist (WEB_TO_ANDROID_MAPPING.md)
- [ ] Test on 5+ devices (various manufacturers)
- [ ] Beta test with 10+ machine owners
- [ ] Validate all protocol frames match web app
- [ ] Check release checklist (ANDROID_ROADMAP.md Phase 10)
- [ ] Prepare Play Store materials

---

## 🚨 Critical Warnings

### ⚠️ Protocol Must Be Byte-Perfect
The BLE protocol frames **must match the web app exactly** or the machine won't respond. Use the validation tests in WEB_TO_ANDROID_MAPPING.md to verify every frame.

### ⚠️ Test on Real Hardware Early
Don't wait until "it's ready" to test with a Vitruvian machine. Test the connection and basic commands within the first week of development.

### ⚠️ Android 12+ Permissions Are Different
Bluetooth permissions changed significantly in Android 12. Follow the manifest setup in ANDROID_QUICK_START.md exactly.

### ⚠️ Don't Skip the Command Queue
The web app uses a GATT operation queue to prevent "operation already in progress" errors. Android needs the same mechanism—don't skip it!

## 🎯 Success Milestones

Track your progress:

- [ ] **Week 1:** Project set up, can scan for BLE devices
- [ ] **Week 2:** Can connect to Vitruvian, send init sequence
- [ ] **Week 3:** Can start a basic workout (Old School mode)
- [ ] **Week 4:** Real-time monitoring working
- [ ] **Week 6:** MVP UI complete
- [ ] **Week 8:** Beta ready for testing
- [ ] **Week 12:** Feature-complete, polish phase
