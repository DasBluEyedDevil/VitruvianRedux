# AbstractC* Files to Keep As-Is

This document lists the AbstractC* and C[digit]* files that should **NOT** be renamed, with justification.

## AbstractC* Files (9 files)

These files lack clear semantic meaning from their toString() methods or structure.

### 1. AbstractC3712a
- **Path**: `com/vitruvian/app/ui/coaching/classes/AbstractC3712a.java`
- **Original Smali**: `a.1.smali`
- **Reason**: Single inner class, no toString() methods, no clear semantic purpose

### 2. AbstractC3718c
- **Path**: `com/vitruvian/app/ui/coaching/classes/AbstractC3718c.java`
- **Original Smali**: `c.1.smali`
- **Reason**: 6 inner classes, no toString() methods, unclear semantic purpose

### 3. AbstractC3731g0
- **Path**: `com/vitruvian/app/ui/coaching/classes/AbstractC3731g0.java`
- **Original Smali**: `g0.1.smali`
- **Reason**: 6 inner classes, no toString() methods, unclear semantic purpose

### 4. AbstractC3740j0
- **Path**: `com/vitruvian/app/ui/coaching/classes/AbstractC3740j0.java`
- **Original Smali**: `j0.1.smali`
- **Reason**: Single inner class, no toString() methods, minimal structure

### 5. AbstractC3746l0
- **Path**: `com/vitruvian/app/ui/coaching/classes/AbstractC3746l0.java`
- **Original Smali**: `l0.1.smali`
- **Reason**: 4 inner classes, no toString() methods, unclear semantic purpose

### 6. AbstractC3772x
- **Path**: `com/vitruvian/app/ui/coaching/classes/AbstractC3772x.java`
- **Original Smali**: `x.1.smali`
- **Reason**: 2 inner classes, no toString() methods, minimal structure

### 7. AbstractC3778a
- **Path**: `com/vitruvian/app/ui/coaching/programs/AbstractC3778a.java`
- **Original Smali**: `a.1.smali`
- **Reason**: Single inner class, no toString() methods, minimal structure

### 8. AbstractC3911o
- **Path**: `com/vitruvian/app/ui/workouts/builder/AbstractC3911o.java`
- **Original Smali**: `o.1.smali`
- **Reason**: Single inner class, no toString() methods, minimal structure

### 9. AbstractC3913p
- **Path**: `com/vitruvian/app/ui/workouts/builder/AbstractC3913p.java`
- **Original Smali**: `p.1.smali`
- **Reason**: 2 inner classes, no toString() methods, unclear semantic purpose

## C[digit]* Files (292 files)

All 292 C[digit]* files should be kept as-is for the following reasons:

### Primary Reasons

1. **Lambda Implementations** (~80%)
   - Compiler-generated lambda classes
   - Implement functional interfaces (InterfaceC7725l, InterfaceC7730q, etc.)
   - No semantic benefit from renaming
   - Examples: C0, C3713a0, C3935b

2. **Compose UI Components** (~10%)
   - Jetpack Compose UI components
   - Auto-generated by Compose compiler
   - Examples: C3947a

3. **Screen Implementation Classes** (~10%)
   - Screen logic and UI composition
   - Often have meaningful structure but JADX naming is for conflict resolution
   - Examples: C3833a

### Risk Factors

Renaming C[digit]* files introduces significant risk:

- **Breaking Changes**: 292 files with potentially thousands of cross-references
- **Case Sensitivity**: JADX numbering resolves case-insensitive filesystem conflicts
- **Compilation Errors**: High risk of missing references during bulk rename
- **Maintenance Burden**: Extensive testing required for minimal readability gain
- **Future Conflicts**: Could conflict with new files in future decompilation

### Examples by Package

#### coaching/classes (72 files)
All files from C0.java to C3777z0.java are lambda implementations, event handlers, and UI components.

#### coaching/programs (24 files)
Files C3779b.java to C3802z.java are navigation handlers and state management.

#### device (4 files)
Files C3803a.java to C3806d.java are lambda implementations.

#### experimental (25 files)
Files C3807a.java to C3831z.java are UI components and event handlers.

#### settings (40 files)
Files C3833a.java to C3872y.java include screen implementations and lambda handlers.

#### settings/v2 (15 files)
Files C3855b.java to C3869p.java are UI components for settings v2.

#### workouts/builder (60 files)
Files C0.java to C3933z0.java are builder pattern implementations and UI components.

#### workouts/justLift/v2 (12 files)
Files C3935b.java to C3946m.java are Just Lift mode implementations.

#### workouts/overview (25 files)
Files C3947a.java to C3971z.java are workout overview screen components.

## Future Revisit Criteria

These files should be reconsidered for renaming if/when:

### For AbstractC* Files
1. **Usage Analysis**: Examination of ViewModel code reveals clear semantic purpose
2. **toString() Added**: Future versions add toString() methods to inner classes
3. **Documentation**: Code comments or external docs provide naming hints
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Similar classes in other packages suggest naming conventions

### For C[digit]* Files
1. **Screen Refactor**: Major screen refactoring exposes semantic purpose
2. **Single File Focus**: Individual file is identified as critical and frequently modified
3. **Pattern Extraction**: A specific subset shows clear naming pattern

### Recommended Analysis Approach
When revisiting files:
1. Check git history for modification patterns
2. Analyze ViewModel state flows and event streams
3. Compare with properly-named neighboring classes
4. Review for Android/Kotlin architectural patterns (State, Event, Effect)
5. Check for sealed class hierarchies indicating state machines

## Quick Reference Table

| Category | Count | Action | Priority for Future Review |
|----------|-------|--------|---------------------------|
| AbstractC* with toString() | 8 | ✅ Rename | N/A (already renamed) |
| AbstractC* without toString() | 9 | ❌ Keep as-is | Medium |
| C[digit]* Lambda | ~240 | ❌ Keep as-is | Very Low |
| C[digit]* Compose UI | ~30 | ❌ Keep as-is | Low |
| C[digit]* Screen Logic | ~22 | ❌ Keep as-is | Medium-Low |

## Notes on JADX Naming Patterns

Understanding why JADX uses these names helps decide when to rename:

### AbstractC[number][letter] Pattern
- **Trigger**: Case-insensitive filesystem + lowercase original name
- **Example**: `x.smali` → `AbstractC3772x.java`
- **When to Rename**: If toString() reveals semantic meaning

### C[number][letter/number] Pattern
- **Trigger**: Name collision resolution
- **Example**: `a$a.smali` → `C0735a.java` (collision with another 'a')
- **When to Rename**: Rarely, only if it's a critical class with clear purpose

### Numbers Only (C0, C1, etc.)
- **Trigger**: Java keyword conflict or duplicate simple names
- **Example**: Multiple `0.smali` files → `C0.java`
- **When to Rename**: Almost never, these are typically lambdas

## Conclusion

**Keep as-is**: 9 AbstractC* files + 292 C[digit]* files = **301 files**

These files should remain with JADX-applied names because:
1. Lack of semantic information makes good naming impossible
2. Risk/benefit ratio strongly favors keeping current names
3. Future analysis may reveal better names
4. JADX naming is consistent and predictable

The 8 renamed files (see ABSTRACT_C_ANALYSIS.md) have clear semantic meaning and benefit significantly from renaming. The remaining files do not meet this threshold.
