## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks: NONE ‚úÖ
All critical risks mitigated with foreground service implementation.

### Medium Risks: LOW

**Potential Issues:**
1. **User denies notification permission**
   - Mitigation: Clear explanation, graceful degradation
   - Impact: Foreground service won't start, but app still works
   - Workaround: User must keep app in foreground

2. **Android aggressive battery optimization**
   - Mitigation: Foreground service should prevent this
   - Impact: Very rare edge cases
   - Workaround: User can whitelist app

3. **BLE hardware issues**
   - Mitigation: Not in our control
   - Impact: Device-specific
   - Workaround: User troubleshooting guide

### Low Risks: ACCEPTABLE

**Minor Issues:**
- Some users might not like persistent notification ‚Üí Can't be helped, Android requirement
- Permission flow might seem complex ‚Üí Necessary for functionality
- Generic notification icon ‚Üí Can improve later

**Conclusion:** Risk profile is excellent for beta release.
