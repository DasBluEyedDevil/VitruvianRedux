The app has been successfully upgraded from Phase 1 (basic functionality) to a fully functional beta release ready for real-world testing and eventual Play Store submission.

## Key Implementations

### 1. Rep Detection Engine ✅
**File:** `domain/usecase/RepDetectionEngine.kt`
- Ported complete rep counting algorithm from web app (app.js)
- Implements rolling position windows for top/bottom detection
- Differentiates between warmup and working reps
- Supports auto-stop for "Just Lift" mode
- Configurable warmup target and total reps
- Returns RepEvent data for UI updates

**Features:**
- Position tracking with 10-sample rolling windows
